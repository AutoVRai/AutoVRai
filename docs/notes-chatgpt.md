# AutoVRai (chatgpt)

AutoVRai is an open-source project that leverages AI to convert and enhance regular images and videos into Flat 3D or VR180. It can be run entirely on local hardware, with a modern mid-range gaming PC serving as a typical setup.

## Features
- Automated conversion with minimal user input
- Default and user-customizable configurations via JSON files
- Multiple modes of interaction including CLI, a local network web app, and a special mode for DeoVR
- In future, native app for Oculus Quest for immersive VR interaction

The primary mode of interaction is via a simple web interface accessible on the local network, but a CLI is also provided for automation and scripting. A special mode for DeoVR allows streaming of VR videos and images to a VR headset.

This project is written in Python and planned for future Docker containerization. It's the perfect project to dive into for both open-source enthusiasts and AI/ML beginners. For a detailed description of the project structure, please refer to the 'Project Structure' section.
